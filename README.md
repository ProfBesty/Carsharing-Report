# CarSharing Report with SQL Queries
### This repo is a documentation of an analysis I did on carsharing data provided by Datafied Academy

## Project Overview
This project will involve analyzing a dataset from a car-sharing company using SQL Queries. The dataset covers the period from January 2017 to August 2018 and contains information about the customers' demand rate. The data was collected on an hourly basis and includes details such as date, hour, season, weather condition, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
The 'demand' column in the dataset represents the customers' willingness to rent a car at a specific time. Higher demand rates indicate that customers are more inclined to rent a car, while lower demand rates suggest less interest. A full description of the data is provided in Table II.

## The Task
The task consists of two parts. The first part includes creating a database with a database management system and answering some business questions. For the second part, I will present a report containing a description of my work and the codes I have written.
